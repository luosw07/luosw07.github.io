👋🏻 Here are some academic resources, including **lecture notes** of mathematics, **course report and presentation slides** in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), **course examinations of previous years** in USTC, and **precious (paper) template** of academic report to be downloaded as you need, especially for undergraduates in USTC.

# 📒 Lecture Notes

## 🌟 Introduction to Life Science & Medicine

This course, whose **rating is based on the lecture notes**, is constructed by various lectures of different topics on biology & medicine by famous experts in these fields.

## 🌟 Electromagnetism Report

In the course Electromagnetism A, I attempted to discover wheather the case that two conductors with like charges can attract each other or not by **numerical simulation methods** (using Mathematica). It turned out to be true before I finished my report and performed a presentation of the (tiny) research experience.
