# 📑 Brief Experience

## 📖 Freshman Year
In the freshman year, I found myself interested in **pure mathematics**, especially in **algebra**. During this year, I learned about basic course in mathematics and physics, including analysis, linear & modern algebra, mechanics and electromagnetism. 
 
During the summer vacation, I attended the **[2024 Algebra & Number Theory Summer School](http://antss.amss.ac.cn)** mainly held by **Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, CAS** and **[Prof. Shouwu ZHANG](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~shouwu/)** from **Princeton University** and learned a little about algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and representation theory of finite groups.

I visited **Wuhan University** in fall and **Shanghai Jiaotong University** in spring as a member of the Student Union of School of the Gifted Young.



## ⏰ Sophomore year

In the second year of undergraduate, I was enrolled in the **Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics**. During this year, I have learned classical theory of partial differential equaions, functional analysis and point-set or algebraic topology and attended seminar of representation theory (Advisor: [Prof. Shucheng YU](https://sites.google.com/site/shuchengyu126/)) & smooth manifolds and performed some talks.

I visited **Fudan University** as a member of the Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics.

I attended the 2025 S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest and obtained **Honorable Mention in Written Exam** on Analysis and Partial Differential Equations.

I performed a 2-month summer research on nonlinear PDEs under the guidance of **[Prof. Zhouping XIN](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=zhouping+xin&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)** and **[Prof. Renjun DUAN](http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~rjduan/)** at **Institude of Mathematical Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong** this summer vacation. The basic topic is about **Fisher Information in Kinetic Theory**. I conducted a focused study of Fisher information methods in kinetic theory (Villani review), translating theory to a finite-velocity discrete model; derived convergence and stability estimates using entropy/Fisher tools.


## ✍️ Junior year

In the junior year, I focus my research interest on kinetic theory (maybe joint with statistics, probability theory, machine learning and analysis). 

In the first semester, I worked as a TA for **Foundation of Algebra** and **Foundation of Geometry** courses for the freshmen of the School of the Gifted Young with advisor **[Prof. Junchao Shentu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Junchao-Shentu)**. I will work as a TA for **Complex Analysis (H)(En)** course for the Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics in the second semester with advisor **[Prof. Bing WANG](https://ustcwangbing.github.io)**.

I will perform a 1-year research in USTC under the guidance of **[Prof. Shunlin Shen](https://shunlinshen.github.io)** on kinetic theory starting from Dec 2025 and plan to go to UW Madison for a 3-month research visit in summer 2026 under the guidance of **[Prof. Qin Li](https://sites.google.com/view/qinlimadison/home)**.

I vistied **Xiaman University** as a member of the Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics in Nov 2025.
