# 🧐 Academic Research Experience

> This is only a **brief** list of my academic research experience with highlights of each research. The detailed information of each experience can be found at the **[research page](/research)**.

## 🌟 2025 Summer Research Placement

- 🌍 **Location:** Hong Kong, China

- ⏰ **Expected Time:** July 2025 - August 2025

- 🏠 **Host Unit:** **[Institude of Mathematical Science](http://www.ims.cuhk.edu.hk), [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://cuhk.edu.hk)**

- 👥 **Host Supervisors:** **[Prof. Zhouping XIN](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=zhouping+xin&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)** and **[Prof. Renjun DUAN](http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~rjduan/)**

- 📖 **Brief Description**: Do the mathematical study under the guidance of Professor Zhouping Xin. The main
research field is to focus on the nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), a rich
and interdisciplinary field for understanding, analyzing, and solving equations
involving partial derivatives of unknown functions, where the equations are nonlinear
in nature. The task is to explore important research directions in the field of nonlinear
PDEs and gain broader interests and knowledges for preparing the future postgraduate
study.

 I am now an undergraduate sophomore student at **[University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn)** majoring in mathematics.

- ⏰ **Time:** September 2023 - Present

- 🌍 **Location:** Hefei, Anhui, PRChina

- 🎓 **Expect Graduation:** July 2027

- 📝 **Latest GPA:** **3.94**/4.30 (**91.33**/100)

- 👥 **Latest Rank:** **15th**/205 among all students majoring in Mathematics at USTC

### 📖 Freshman Year

In the freshman year, I found myself interested in **pure mathematics**, especially in **algebra**. The course *Fundation of Algebra* makes me able to attempt to construct seminar on commutative algebra.

### ⏰ Sophomore year

In the second year of undergraduate, I was enrolled in the **Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics**. During this year, I have learned classical theory of partial differential equaions, functional analysis and point-set or algebraic topology and attended seminar of representation theory & smooth manifolds.

At the very beginning of the first semester, I published **[series of recorded video lectures](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JRpweWE3f)** on **fundamentals of algera** (i.e. introduce basic concepts and properties of algebraic structures and use them to explain elementary number theory and polynomials theory) at [Bilibili](https://bilibili.com), a website platform of videos in China (c.f. [talks](/talks)).

During the first semester, I learned the course *Introduction to Differential Equations*, which introduced basic linear PDEs such as wave equation, heat equation and Poisson's equation, deepening my insight and attrating me into the interest of **partial differential equations (PDEs)**. After that, I attempted to read Evan's textbook *Partial Differential Equations*, learned the concepts like Sobolev spaces and tried to read some paper on PDE research. I will perform a 2-month summer research on **nonlinear PDEs** under the guidance of **[Prof. Zhouping XIN](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=zhouping+xin&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)** and **[Prof. Renjun DUAN](http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~rjduan/)** at **Institude of Mathematical Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong** this summer vacation.

I gave a **lecture on mathematical analysis** to the freshman majoring in mathematics in the first semester (c.f. [talks](/talks)). During the winter vacation, I organized a **seminar on smooth manifolds** and gave 2 lectures "Revision of Topological Manifolds" and "Tangent Space of Smooth Manifolds" by myself. In the second semester, I will attend the **seminar on representation theory** under the guidance of **[Prof. Shucheng YU](https://sites.google.com/site/shuchengyu126/)** and will give 3 lecture, introducing Representations, Maschke’s Theorem, Semisimplicity and The Structure of Algebras for WhichEvery Module Is
Semisimple based on the textbook P. WEBB _A Course in Finite Group Representation Theory_.
