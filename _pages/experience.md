# 🧐 Academic Research Experience

> This is only a **brief** list of my academic research experience with highlights of each research. The detailed information of each experience can be found at the **[research page](/research)**.

## 🌟 2025 Summer Research in Kinetic Theory

- 🌍 **Location:** Hong Kong, China

- ⏰ **Time:** July 2025 - August 2025

- 🏠 **Host Unit:** **[Institude of Mathematical Science](http://www.ims.cuhk.edu.hk), [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://cuhk.edu.hk)**

- 👥 **Host Supervisors:** **[Prof. Zhouping XIN](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=zhouping+xin&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)** and **[Prof. Renjun DUAN](http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~rjduan/)**

- 📖 **Brief Description**: Conducted a focused study of Fisher information methods in kinetic theory (Villani review), translating theory to a finite-velocity discrete model; derived convergence and stability estimates using entropy/Fisher tools.


## Boltzmann Equation with Mass Exchange (based on Degond-Liu’s work)

- 🌍 **Location:** Hefei, Anhui, China

- ⏰ **Expected Time:** December 2025 - May 2026

- 🏠 **Host Unit:** **[School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.ustc.edu.cn), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn)**

- 👥 **Host Supervisor:** **Prof. Shunlin SHEN**

- 📖 **Brief Description**: 
  - Studied Degond-Liu’s mass–exchange Boltzmann model on a mass lattice and formulated a continuous-mass Boltzmann equation as a scaling limit. Established weak compactness of ($f^\varepsilon$) using Dunford–Pettis type arguments and time equicontinuity from the weak formulation.
  - Performed a consistency analysis of the collision operator via truncation and Riemann–sum approximations, exploiting $C^1$-regularity of the kernel and exchange map to identify the continuous-mass limit.
  - *Work in progress*: stability and uniqueness in a local dual (Wasserstein-type) metric and quantitative $O(\varepsilon)$ convergence.

 I am now an undergraduate sophomore student at **[University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn)** majoring in mathematics.

- ⏰ **Time:** September 2023 - Present

- 🌍 **Location:** Hefei, Anhui, PRChina

- 🎓 **Expect Graduation:** July 2027

- 📝 **Latest GPA:** **4.04**/4.30 (**92.42**)

### 📖 Freshman Year

In the freshman year, I found myself interested in **pure mathematics**, especially in **algebra**. The course *Foundation of Algebra* makes me able to attempt to construct seminar on commutative algebra.

### ⏰ Sophomore year

In the second year of undergraduate, I was enrolled in the **Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics**. During this year, I have learned classical theory of partial differential equaions, functional analysis and point-set or algebraic topology and attended seminar of representation theory & smooth manifolds.

At the very beginning of the first semester, I published **[series of recorded video lectures](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JRpweWE3f)** on **fundamentals of algera** (i.e. introduce basic concepts and properties of algebraic structures and use them to explain elementary number theory and polynomials theory) at [Bilibili](https://bilibili.com), a website platform of videos in China (c.f. [talks](/talks)).

During the first semester, I learned the course *Introduction to Differential Equations*, which introduced basic linear PDEs such as wave equation, heat equation and Poisson's equation, deepening my insight and attrating me into the interest of **partial differential equations (PDEs)**. After that, I attempted to read Evan's textbook *Partial Differential Equations*, learned the concepts like Sobolev spaces and tried to read some paper on PDE research. I will perform a 2-month summer research on **nonlinear PDEs** under the guidance of **[Prof. Zhouping XIN](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=zhouping+xin&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)** and **[Prof. Renjun DUAN](http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~rjduan/)** at **Institude of Mathematical Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong** this summer vacation.

I attended the 2025 S.-T. Yau College Student Mathematics Contest and eventually obtained **Honorable Mention in Written Exam** on Analysis and Partial Differential Equations.

I gave a **lecture on mathematical analysis** to the freshman majoring in mathematics in the first semester (c.f. [talks](/talks)). During the winter vacation, I organized a **seminar on smooth manifolds** and gave 2 lectures "Revision of Topological Manifolds" and "Tangent Space of Smooth Manifolds" by myself. In the second semester, I will attend the **seminar on representation theory** under the guidance of **[Prof. Shucheng YU](https://sites.google.com/site/shuchengyu126/)** and will give 3 lecture, introducing Representations, Maschke’s Theorem, Semisimplicity and The Structure of Algebras for WhichEvery Module Is
Semisimple based on the textbook P. WEBB _A Course in Finite Group Representation Theory_.
