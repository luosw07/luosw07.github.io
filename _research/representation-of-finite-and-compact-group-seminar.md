Under the guidance of **[Prof. Shucheng YU](https://sites.google.com/site/shuchengyu126/)** at USTC, a seminar on representation of finite groups and compact groups is organized.

I was invited to perform **3 lectures of the construction of representations, Schur's lemma, Maschke's theorem, and the irreducible decomposition of regular representations of finite groups**. I will discuss some preliminaries in commutative algebra, such as modules and algebras as complement. The main textbook is P. WEBB _A Coursein Finite Group Representation Theory_.
