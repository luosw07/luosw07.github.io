I will visit Institude of Mathematical Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong and perform a 2-month short-term research on nonlinear PDEs under the guidance of **[Prof. Zhouping XIN](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=zhouping+xin&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)** and **[Prof. Renjun DUAN](http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~rjduan/)** during 2025 summer vacation.

- 🌍 **Location:** Hong Kong, China

- ⏰ **Expected Time:** July 2025 - August 2025

- 🏠 **Host Unit:** **[Institude of Mathematical Science](http://www.ims.cuhk.edu.hk), [Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://cuhk.edu.hk)**

- 👥 **Host Supervisors:** **[Prof. Zhouping XIN](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=zhouping+xin&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)** and **[Prof. Renjun DUAN](http://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~rjduan/)**

- 📖 **Brief Description**: Do the mathematical study under the guidance of Professor Zhouping Xin. The main research field is to focus on the nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), a rich and interdisciplinary field for understanding, analyzing, and solving equations involving partial derivatives of unknown functions, where the equations are nonlinear in nature. The task is to explore important research directions in the field of nonlinear PDEs and gain broader interests and knowledges for preparing the future postgraduate study.
