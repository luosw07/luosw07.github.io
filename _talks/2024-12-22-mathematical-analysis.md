As the final exams are approaching, in order to help students review and prepare for the exams, the Department of Mathematical Sciences organized a guidance lecture in classroom 2121 on December 22, 2024, at USTC. The event was hosted by the Youth League Committee of the Department and organized by the Student Union of the Department.

I was invited to perform **a lecture of mathematical analysis**, as well as the review methods and suggestions for adjusting the mentality at the end of the semester.

I narrated my lecture along the two main lines of **from convergence to continuity** and **from differentials to derivatives**. On the basis of introducing the basic theory, I emphasized the important role of **motivation** and **examples** in the theory, and introduced the viewpoints of **topology** and **geometry** to assist in looking at the concepts in mathematical analysis. In the Q&A session, I tried to discuss some valuable questions with the audience.
