The undergraduates at Hua Loo-Keng Talent Program in Mathematics organized a seminar on smooth manifolds after learning topology and basic differential geometry during 2025 winter vacation. I gave 2 lectures in this seminar and the following is the first lecture on **topological manifolds**.

I first gave a revision of basic concepts, such as **countability and separability** in point-set topology before introducing definition and properties of topological manifolds. I also discussed concepts like **local homeomorphism, topological group and the homogenous property of connected topological manifolds**.
